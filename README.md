# Elevvo Pathways Front-End Web Development Internship

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing the projects completed during the Elevvo Pathways Front-End Internship. This repository serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my acquired skills, featuring four distinct projects focused on modern front-end development principles. These tasks were designed to reinforce fundamental and advanced concepts, demonstrating my skills learning languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+), along with the practical application of the React library for building dynamic user interfaces and proficiency in creating responsive and accessible designs. The repository is organized for clarity, with each project residing in its own folder, which contains all the source code, a screenshot of the final result, and a dedicated README file outlining the project goals and implementation details. Feel free to explore the individual task folders to see the code and results for each project!
